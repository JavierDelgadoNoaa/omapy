Oh My Another Plot/Product Yielder

This program plots meterological fields from a map. It uses the
specdata library from nwpy, making it possible to plot data from
a wide variety of input sources. The plots are highly configurable via
config files.

The best way to learn how to use it:
1. Run "omap.py -h" to see options and usage
2. See included, highly-commented config file, main.conf, for how to describe 
   the plots to be generated
