# File naming convention. Keywords used for format() are acceptable
# The datetime keywords are: 'cal_date' for calendar date corresponding
# to the forecast time (i.e. init_date + forecast offset), 
# Other keywords: 
# 	'fhr' = forecast hour 
#	'fmin' = forecast minute
#   dom = domain number

# Maps fields to their corresponding dimension names and variables.
# In some cases, there is no variable associated with the 
# dimension (e.g. HWRF atmospheric value which are specified
# at midlayer, but only the interface pressure is available). In this case,
# just put a '-'
## Don't have this since fields are @ midlayer but only have interface value

[latlon2field_mappings]
# Specify mappings from horizontal coordinate to field name
# This is only needed if the dimension name is not identical
# to the variable name. (e.g. if a field has dimensions 
# 'lat' and 'lon' and the corresponding variables containing 
# the dimension data are named 'lat' and 'lon', it is not
# necessary to specify a meapping here.
# 
# The mappings here are from the dimension variable's name to the 
# field name. The dimension's dimension name is a property of 
# the field itself, so it does not need to be specified.
# The mapping from dimension variable to dimension is specified in 
# [var2dim_mappings]
#
# One default option is allowed using '*'.
# e.g. if the output is on a staggered grid where the U and V variables
# are on a grid whose coordinates are specified with ULAT, ULON and 
# the rest are on a grid whose coordinates are specified with HLAT,
# HLON, you would have:
HLAT,HLON = *
VLAT,VLON = U,V

##
# For Variables that have a "level_type" or "level_indicator" attribute, the _getstaggerloc() method
# of SpecData will make assumptions on what the values currently are for GriB.
# This assumption will be based on current parameter tables, so if the GriB meisters decide to 
# change things in the future, bad things may happen

#         lat/lon location (see pg. 5 of g5nr filespec)
